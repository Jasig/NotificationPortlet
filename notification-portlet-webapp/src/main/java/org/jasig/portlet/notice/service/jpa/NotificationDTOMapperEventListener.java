/**
 * Provide hooks for additional post-processing that can be handled during dozer
 * mapping.  Currently only supports adding class specific processing that can
 * be applied after dozer is done.  NOTE:  Dozer events only fire on the root object, not
 * on child objects.  If you have a hierarchy of objects, the mapping class will
 * need to be wired with the logic to handle the child object post processing
 * (unfortunately).
